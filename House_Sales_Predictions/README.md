# House Sales in USA - Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict house prices in the USA using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical sales data, we can build predictive models that help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes historical house sales data with features such as:

- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms

- Square footage

- Location details

- Year built

- Other key property attributes


## Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Data Handling:** pandas, numpy

- **Data Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn

- **Machine Learning:** sklearn, Linear Regression

- **Other Utilities:** warnings, piplite


## Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading & Preprocessing

- Import and clean the dataset

- Handle missing values

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering

- Scale numerical features

- Apply polynomial transformations

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building & Training

- Implement Linear and Ridge Regression models

- Train models using train_test_split

- Evaluate performance with cross-validation

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation & Insights

- Visualize predictions vs. actual values

- Assess model performance using error metrics

## Results & Insights

- The Ridge Regression model performed better than standard Linear Regression.

- Feature scaling and polynomial transformations improved predictions.

- Data visualization helped uncover key trends in house pricing.
