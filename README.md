- **SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction:** This project aims to predict the success of Falcon 9's first-stage landing using machine learning techniques. By analyzing launch conditions, payloads, and orbital details, we provide insights that can assist competitive space ventures in planning cost-effective missions.

- **Titanic Survival Prediction:** This project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning. It leverages Python's data science ecosystem and follows a structured approach to data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- **Auto Sales During Recessions:** This project explores the impact of recessions on automobile sales by leveraging data visualization and data analysis techniques. Using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium, we uncover historical trends in vehicle sales during economic downturns [Link to Project >>](https://github.com/amgfigueiredo/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Auto-Sales-Recessions)

- **House Sales in USA:** In this project, we are working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. We are tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. We will analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on.
