# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning. It leverages Python's data science ecosystem and follows a structured approach to data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature selection.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and correlations.

- **Model Training**: Training and comparing multiple classification models.

- **Evaluation**: Measuring model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python

- **Data Manipulation**: pandas, numpy

- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn

- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn

## ðŸ“¥ Installation

Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies using:

- pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## ðŸ”„ Workflow

1. Load the Titanic dataset.
2. Perform data cleaning and handle missing values.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
4. Apply feature engineering techniques (encoding, scaling, etc.).
5. Train multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, etc.).
6. Evaluate model performance using classification metrics.
7. Compare models and choose the best one.

## ðŸ“Š Results

- The best-performing model was determined based on cross-validation scores.

- Feature importance and correlations were analyzed to improve predictions.
